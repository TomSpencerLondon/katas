# [Quadratic primes](https://projecteuler.net/problem=27)

## Introduction
Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:
n^2 + n + 41

It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes
for the consecutive integer values 0 <= n <= 39. However, when
n = 40, 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is divisible by 41 and certainly when n = 41, 41^2 + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41.

The incredible formula
